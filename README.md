# resend-slack-invite
 
Small webhook that uses Puppeteer to request a new Slack invite for a previously invited user.

Disclaimer: this could stop working at literally any time!

## Why?

Slack doesn't provide a simple way to programmatically invite users to a workspace [unless you're on an Enterprise plan](https://api.slack.com/methods/admin.users.invite) ðŸ™ƒ. There used to be an undocumented API, but it [no longer works except with legacy tokens](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30955818/slack-api-team-invitation) (unavailable to all new apps).

This leaves us with [SCIM](https://api.slack.com/scim#scim-api-endpoints__users), intended for use with SSO and external identity management. **The SCIM API is unfortunately only available to Pro workspaces.** 

When you provision a user with SCIM, it doesn't send the usual invite email. This tool provides an endpoint to request a new invite email be sent through Slack's password reset page. When you request a password reset for a user provisioned through SCIM*, Slack notices that the user hasn't accepted the invite yet and sends a new one.

\* The user must be provisioned with a password in order for this to work.

## Usage

First, provision a user using the SCIM API. Make sure to [read the notes about generating tokens](https://api.slack.com/scim#accessing-the-scim-api__particulars-of-permissions) for use with SCIM.

An example request:

```
POST https://api.slack.com/scim/v1/Users
```
```json
{
  "schemas": [
    "urn:scim:schemas:core:1.0",
    "urn:scim:schemas:extension:enterprise:1.0"
  ],
  "emails": [
    {
      "value": "user@example.com", 
      "primary": true
    }
  ],
  "userName": "Name Name",
  "displayName": "Name Name",
  "active": true,
  "password": "[randomly generated]"
}
```

Once the user is provisioned, send a request to the `resend-slack-invite` server containing the new user's email:

```
POST /resend
```
```json
{
  "email": "user@example.com"
}
```

If the response code is 200, the invite was successful.

## Authentication

*TODO this could be more secure*

Set the `TOKEN` environment variable to a randomly generated secret. Use this as a [Bearer token](https://learning.postman.com/docs/sending-requests/authorization/#bearer-token) in the `Authorization` header of the request. Consider also not exposing the service to the web and keeping it inside your cloud network's firewall.
